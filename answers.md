1. You would need cards and thats pretty much it on your desk. Maybe a pencil and notepad to keep score. The instance variables are cards remaining, cards in deck, win count, ranks, suits, and board size.

2. You would need some sort of randomizer that deals out 9 cards at random and remove them from the deck. It will then take random cards from the deck depending on how many are picked. It will end the game if it is not possible to draw cards.

3. It has everything except its missing a win count variable.

4. a. The  ElevensBoard contructor and newGame method.

4. b.  isLegal and anotherPlayIsPossible

4. c.  0,1,3,6,7
4. d. for (i = 0; i < List.size; i ++) {
	System.out.println(cards[i]);
}

4. e. anotherPlayIsPossible because it needs to know if there are enough indexes left for a possible play
