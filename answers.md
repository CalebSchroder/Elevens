 1.  Buggy1: Method=deck constructor
 There must be some mistyoe error in the for loop that is making it so the deck is not empty. Probably an incorrect less than or greater than sign is wrong

 2. Buggy2: Method=size
 The limits must be set incortrectly in the for loop making the size not 1.

 3. Buggy3: Method=shuffle
 The code did not randomize the cards in the shuffle method, leaving it the same as the previous

 4. Buggy4: Method= Deal
 The deal card has some error making the card null, maybe having the size reduction in the wrong place
